The event started on time (10:30am) with Tony introducing MetaRefresh, HasGeek and Wingify to the attendees. Siddharth Deswal, Marketing Guru at Wingify kickstarted the event with his talk on "How to Communicate Better with Marketing, Sales and Other 'Business' Types", along with shots of humour. The talk started with the narration of his own experience of wearing different hats at Wingify with him helping different departments. He concluded on a great note saying that different departments shouldn't be isolated and must focus on sharing and imparting knowledge to people from other departments, especially the ones who are interdependent; the best example being that marketing team should also try to understand the technical aspects related to feature development.

A pure technical talk related to web performance, started off with a poll to find out how many of the participants measure performance regularly and have it part of their deployment process, the feedback from the attendees depicted negligible measures taken to continously monitor product performance. Next was the discussion of the reasons on why performance mattered, which was followed up with the discussion of various hacks that people employed to bring performance to their applications. The core part of this talk discussed the difference between using hacks versus following different approach during development, and how each of them paid in the long run.
