At Wingify, we believe in open source and actively seek opportunities to give back to the community. We make use of a lot of open source technologies and libraries in our day to day work. And to share back the love, we have open sourced [quite](https://github.com/wingify/please.js) a few [things](https://github.com/wingify/lua-resty-rabbitmqstomp) over the past.

Pravendra Singh, a computer geek, recently went on to actually collect and visualize data about [open source contributions of some of the leading startups in India](http://pravj.github.io/blog/open-source-presence-infographic/).

Something really cool that came into picture from his infographics was that Wingify was leading other organizations in terms of the most starred repository - our [**Please.js**](https://github.com/wingify/please.js). Moreover, we have three more of our repositories that made it to the top 10!

There are more such cool infographics in his blog post - [Open Source Presence Infographic of Indian Startups](http://pravj.github.io/blog/open-source-presence-infographic/).

We keep doing a lot of cool open source stuff and if you are into such things, don't forget to [follow us on github](https://github.com/wingify) and on [twitter](https://twitter.com/wingify_engg).
