Open source is something which is at the core of what we do at Wingify. We use a lot of open source technologies & libraries in day to day work. And to share back with the community we have open sourced [quite](https://github.com/wingify/please.js) a few [things](https://github.com/wingify/lua-resty-rabbitmqstomp) over the past.

Pravendra Singh, a computer geek, recently went on to actually collect data about [open source contributions of leading startups in India](http://pravj.github.io/blog/open-source-presence-infographic/) and visualise them.

Something really cool that came out of his infographics was Wingify leading the other organizations in terms of most starred repository - our [**Please.js**](https://github.com/wingify/please.js). Moreover, we have 3 more of our repositories in the top 10!

We keep doing a lot of cool open source stuff and if you are into such things, don't forget to [follow us on github](https://github.com/wingify).
