The front-end has become the heart of today's web application development, and JavaScript drives a core part of it. New technologies, libraries, frameworks and the likes come up each day, and the existing ones continue to grow and evolve as time goes by. There is so much to learn, and so many learnings of your own to share, that community involvement becomes indispensable.

Our single-page application, VWO, is powered by a nifty combination of web technologies on the front-end, ranging from Grunt to AngularJS. The development process of the new version of the application was very rapid and full of challenges. We had dabbled into the previously unexplored territory of single-page application development at such a large scale, and having pulled it off in a relatively short span of time has been quite a feat.

## Sponsoring JSFoo

For the very reason of communit involvement being indespensable for better development, we are sponsoring JSFoo 2014 in Bangalore this year. Our engineers will be present at the conference. Should you be interested in our work, and would like to know more about what we do, want to work with us, or just want to say Hi!, drop by our booth (INSERT BOOTH HERE), or catch any of our team members at the event.

## JSFoo Run-up Event (Delhi)

We're also hosting a run-up event at our office in Pitampura, Delhi on September 6<sup>th</sup>. As a part of the run-up event, we're organising an online JavaScript competition. The theme for the competition is *Visualize*.
