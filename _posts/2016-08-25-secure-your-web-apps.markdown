Recently I spoke about Securing Web Applications at [JSChannel Conferenceâ€™16][1]. The conference venue was The Ritz-Carlton, Bangalore.
JSChannel is a great conference to attend and to connect with some great people. And when I say great, I literally mean it, Yehuda Katz (one of the creators of Ember.js), Lea Verou (Expert in the W3C CSS Working Group) & Chris Lilley (Father of SVG) and experts from McKinsey.

Three Wingifighters flew to attend and listen to this amazing conference and here we are, showing off some swag.ðŸ¤˜

Day 1 was amazing and Rachit, having attended almost all the sessions, has shared his learning experience at the conference on the [Team Wingifyâ€™s Space][2].

### BEFORE SPEAKING
Speaking at a conference is a lot of work before getting on stage. Preparation is crucial. I spent a good number of hours to jot down a list of security vulnerabilities to talk about and the mitigation steps for the same. I had to make sure none of my demonstrations exposed the vulnerabilities of the websites I chose to talk about.

And guess what, In my preparation for the demo, I actually found another way to bypass a previous reported vulnerability in time before the conference.
Keeping in mind the JavaScript conference and the audience, everything was related to Browser level attacks and Node.js applications.

### THE TALK
<div style="width: 100%">
    <script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="73bbddb59072472a88de3b22005089f1" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

It all started with a humorous introduction and a show of my prowess!
> Security is like the elephant in the room where everyone agrees that it's very important but only a few take it very seriously.

I touched upon recent Github Reused Password attack and why we should follow a good password hygiene and move towards Multi-factor authentication (MFA).

#### XSS

**Rule of thumb** Validate Input and Escape output

#### CSRF
XSS + CSRF = Game Over !!

A sample web application using Node.js, Express and Angular that is vulnerable to common security vulnerabilities were demonstrated. <a href='https://github.com/djadmin/vulnerable-app' target='_blank'>Code</a>


### What could possibly go wrong?
The talk ended with a live demonstration of an interesting and a serious vulnerability found on a popular hiring platform, RecruiterBox. A JavaScript injection using which an attacker can upload a maliciously crafted resume and perform Cross-site Scripting attacks. I used Burp Suite, an interceptor proxy to bypass the fix deployed by Recruiterbox, for the demonstration purpose.
To know more about the vulnerability, [read this][3].

### Feedback:
After the talk, it was rewarding to see good response and queries from the audience. One comment I received from an audience was "We just realized that our services are vulnerable to one of the attack I demonstrated and we never gave a thought to it. Thank you!".

__My 2 cents for attending any tech conference__

More than the talks themselves, it is the people that you should attend the conference for. You should meet the other attendees! If a particular talk is interesting and useful then you can and should talk to the speaker.

__Key takeaways:__

1.  Never blindly trust user input.
2.  Always use proven sanitizers and tools.
3.  Perform Security Audits.
4.  Keep discussing vulnerabilities because the Internet has a bunch of weird old stuff that not necessarily every software developer knows about.

As a first-time speaker, I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect. It turned out to be a great experience and received very positive feedback.
